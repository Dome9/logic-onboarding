==================
Log.ic on-boarding
==================

The onboarding will connect each NSG in the selected ResourceGroup in each region to a StorageAccount.
The script generates an output file which containing subscription id, resource group, storage_account name and key with a list of NSGs. When there is more than 1 storage account, the output file will be generated with a list of Storage accouns, each with itâ€™s own NSGs.
 
Prerequisites
=============

Before running the script make sure that:

* AZ client is installed (Azure command line)
* Python3.5 and above is installed
* Each location of NSGs under the ResourceGroup that should be on-boarded to Logic has a 
  StorageAccount (Highly recommended that the StorageAccount is dedicated to flow logs).
* Make sure that your Azure subscription has the Microsoft.Insights enabled:
  1. go to the Azure Portal
  2. Subscriptions
  3. Click your subscription name
  4. Find `microsoft.insights` in the list 
  5. Make sure that it is enabled, if not click it and then click "Register"

 
  Keep in mind that flow logs must be sent to StorageAccount in the same location as the 
  Resource Group.
